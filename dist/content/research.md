**Our mission**

## Why should we study AI in materials science?

For decades, progress in materials science has relied heavily on experimental discovery and theoretical modeling. These traditional approaches, while powerful, are often time-intensive, resource-demanding, and limited in their ability to fully explore the vast chemical and structural design space of materials. The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) has introduced a transformative paradigm—one that can accelerate discovery, enhance predictive accuracy, and optimize material properties in ways that were previously unattainable.

Over the last few years, AI-driven techniques have enabled breakthroughs by rapidly analyzing large-scale datasets, identifying complex correlations, and generating new hypotheses for material synthesis. This has given rise to data-centric research methodologies, where simulations, high-throughput experiments, and AI algorithms form a synergistic loop to guide material innovation.

As we move into the era of data-driven materials design, the integration of AI is no longer optional—it is a necessity for staying at the forefront of technological development. In particular, AI can significantly reduce the cycle time between concept and realization, facilitate autonomous laboratories, and enable inverse design approaches, where desired properties lead directly to material candidates. This approach holds the potential to revolutionize not only fundamental materials discovery but also device fabrication and industrial-scale production.

In this context, our research group is dedicated to developing AI methodologies specifically tailored for materials science, focusing on both predictive modeling and experimental automation. We aim to create AI models capable of handling complex, multi-dimensional datasets while respecting physical constraints and domain knowledge. Our key research directions include:

### Accelerating Quantum Chemistry

Quantum chemistry provides the fundamental understanding of materials behavior, which is crucial for designing new drugs, catalysts, and energy materials. However, traditional quantum chemical calculations are computationally expensive, limiting their application to relatively small systems or short timescales. Accelerating these calculations through innovative computational methods, particularly those leveraging artificial intelligence, can unlock new frontiers in chemical and materials science, enabling faster discovery and more accurate predictions.

The traditional trial-and-error approach to materials discovery is often slow, expensive, and inefficient. The advent of big data, coupled with advances in machine learning and AI, offers a paradigm shift towards data-driven approaches. By systematically analyzing vast amounts of materials data, we can identify hidden patterns, predict properties of new materials, and significantly accelerate the design and synthesis of materials with desired functionalities for applications ranging from energy storage to catalysis and beyond.

### Autonomous Laboratory

The integration of robotics, artificial intelligence, and high-throughput experimentation is leading to the concept of the "Autonomous Lab" or "Self-Driving Laboratory." These systems can design experiments, execute them, analyze results, and decide on the next steps iteratively and with minimal human intervention. This approach promises to dramatically accelerate the pace of scientific discovery, particularly in materials science and chemistry, by enabling rapid exploration of vast parameter spaces.
